# Auto Screen Translator
Auto Screen Translator automatically translates the text from the images in a specific folder into another language using [Selenium](https://pypi.org/project/selenium), [undetected chromedriver](https://pypi.org/project/undetected-chromedriver), [Pillow](https://pypi.org/project/pillow) and [Google Translate website](https://translate.google.com).

Created to play Doubutsu no Mori e+ in English, but should work for other things too if configured.

Special thanks to:
* ChatGPT for existing
* Nintendo for not localizing Doubutsu no Mori e+
* Alicja for all the support ðŸ’œ
