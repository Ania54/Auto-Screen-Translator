# Auto-Screen-Translator
Auto-Screen-Translator automatically translates the text from the screen into another language using [Pillow](https://pypi.org/project/pillow/), [OpenCV](https://pypi.org/project/opencv-python/), [Python-tesseract](https://pypi.org/project/pytesseract/) and [Googletrans](https://pypi.org/project/googletrans/).

Created to play Doubutsu no Mori e+ in English, but should work for other things too if configured.

Special thanks to:
* ChatGPT for existing
* Alicja for all the support ðŸ’œ
